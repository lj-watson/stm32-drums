# STM32 Drum Machine

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a drum machine on an STM32 that is capable of playing and mixing different sounds, in addition to recording and playing back user inputs.

## Running
This code was created using an STM32 Nucleo F446ZE. This is definitely overkill, a smaller board could work just as well (given it has a large flash memory). The ioc file is included for reference.

## Method
The drum machin
